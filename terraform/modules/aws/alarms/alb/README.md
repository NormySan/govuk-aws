## Modules: aws/alarm/alb

This module creates the following CloudWatch alarms in the  
AWS/ApplicationELB namespace:

  - HTTPCode\_Target\_4XX\_Count greater than or equal to threshold
  - HTTPCode\_Target\_5XX\_Count greater than or equal to threshold
  - HTTPCode\_ELB\_4XX\_Count greater than or equal to threshold
  - HTTPCode\_ELB\_5XX\_Count greater than or equal to threshold

All metrics are measured during a period of 60 seconds and evaluated  
during 5 consecutive periods.

To disable any alarm, set the threshold parameter to 0.
