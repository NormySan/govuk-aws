## Modules: aws/network/private\_subnet

This module creates AWS private subnets on a given VPC, each one  
with a route table and route table association.

Subnet CIDR and AZ are specified in the maps `subnet_cidrs` and
`subnet_availability_zones`, where the key is the name of the  
subnet and must be the same in both maps.

For instance, to create two private subnets named "my\_subnet\_a"  
and "my\_subnet\_b" on eu-west-1a and eu-west-1b, you can do:

```
subnet_cidrs = {
  "my_subnet_a" = "10.0.0.0/24"
  "my_subnet_b" = "10.0.1.0/24"
}

subnet_availability_zones = {
  "my_subnet_a" = "eu-west-1a"
  "my_subnet_b" = "eu-west-1b"
}
```

You can optionally provide a subnet\_nat\_gateways variable, indicating  
the NAT Gateway ID that a subnet can use. If specified, then a  
route will also be added by this module, enabling Internet access. The  
keys in subnet\_nat\_gateways that identify the subnet name must match the  
keys provided in subnet\_cidrs and subnet\_availability\_zones.

If you provide subnet\_nat\_gateways, then subnet\_nat\_gateways\_length  
must also be provided with the number of elements in the subnet\_nat\_gateways  
map. This is necessary to get around a Terraform issue that prevents a
"count" from evaluating computed values. Probably referenced here:
