## Project: infra-govuk-cdn-logs-monitor-bucket

Stores data that is being archived due to the retirement of
[govuk-cdn-logs-monitor](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-cdn-logs-monitor).  
The intention is for this to be temporary and data won't be added to this  
after archiving. So if you're reading this in June 2019 this is pretty safe  
to delete.
